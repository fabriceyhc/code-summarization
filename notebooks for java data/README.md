# Setting up an environment to run these notebooks

There are two main ways to run these notebooks containing the commands for executing OpenNMT-py's implementation of a transformer. 
The first is to run them locally. This is not recommended unless you have a GPU. The alternative is to set up a cloud instance on a 
platform like Google Cloud with a GPU to run 10-50x faster (which will still require 12-20hrs depending on the dataset). 

If you opt for the later, I recommend following the steps contained in the following [link](https://github.com/cs231n/gcloud). 

Once you have your environment, you need to make sure you have a copy of [OpenNMT-py's](https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py) directories
running adjacent to the notebook.
