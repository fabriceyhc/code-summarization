Most of the implementation is taken from https://github.com/santhoshkolloju/Abstractive-Summarization-With-Transfer-Learning


The dataset is not uploaded due to memory concerns. It can be generated by running the data_preprocess.ipynb notebook on the data from 'code-summarization\data\python\original data'.
